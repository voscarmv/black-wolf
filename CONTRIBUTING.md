# Black Wolf Agency Website Development Practices

Welcome to the Black Wolf Agency website development team. To maintain code consistency and quality, it's important to follow good practices while working on this project. Below are some guidelines for HTML, CSS, and adding vanilla JavaScript to the codebase.

## General Practices

1. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and commit regularly. Create descriptive commit messages.

2. **Collaboration**: When collaborating with other team members, coordinate changes to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth development.

3. **File Structure**: Maintain a clear and organized file structure to make it easy for team members to locate files.

## HTML Guidelines

1. **HTML Validation**: Ensure that the HTML code is valid and follows the HTML5 standards. Use the W3C Markup Validation Service if necessary.

2. **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`) to improve accessibility and SEO.

3. **Indentation**: Indent HTML code consistently for readability.

4. **Comments**: Add comments to describe complex sections of HTML code or for the benefit of other team members.

## CSS Guidelines

1. **CSS Organization**: Organize CSS code into separate files based on functionality. Use clear file and folder names.

2. **Selectors**: Use meaningful class and ID names to improve code readability. Avoid overly specific selectors.

3. **Comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of CSS rules and any unusual techniques or workarounds.

4. **Mobile-First**: Follow the mobile-first approach for responsiveness.

5. **Media Queries**: Use media queries to adapt styles for different screen sizes and devices.

## JavaScript Guidelines

1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Use plain JavaScript (vanilla JS) when adding interactivity. Avoid jQuery or other libraries unless required.

2. **Modular Code**: Organize JavaScript code into modular functions or classes for reusability and maintainability.

3. **Comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of functions and any complex logic.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide feedback to users.

## Development Tools

1. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Utilize VSCode for a seamless development experience. It offers features like code linting, auto-formatting, and extensions for live preview, making development efficient.

2. **Live Server Extension**: Use the "Live Preview" (ms-vscode.live-server) extension in VSCode to create a local development server for live previews.

3. **Extensions**: Explore VSCode extensions that can assist with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development, such as Prettier for code formatting and ESLint for code linting.

## Testing

1. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure the website functions correctly on different web browsers, including the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

2. **Responsiveness**: Test the website on various screen sizes and devices to ensure it's responsive.

3. **User Experience (UX)**: Test the website's functionality to provide a smooth user experience.

4. **Accessibility**: Check that the website complies with accessibility standards and is usable by people with disabilities.

## Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your code, including README files, comments in code, and inline code documentation.

2. **Change Logs**: Keep a change log to track modifications, updates, and bug fixes in the project.

By following these practices, we can maintain a high-quality codebase and ensure smooth collaboration within our development team. If you have questions or need further clarification on any of these practices, feel free to reach out to the team.
